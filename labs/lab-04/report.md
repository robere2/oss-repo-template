2. Done
3. Without a license, you retain your rights as the exclusive copyright holder. This means other people are not allowed to distribute, use, modify, etc. your code, even if you give them these rights in passing (e.g., "you can use my code however you want" is not a valid license, because it's not specific enough). By providing a license, you're explicitly stating what a user can and can't do with your code.
4. As I mentioned above, if a project doesn't have a license, you aren't really permitted to do anything with the code. By making contributions to code without a license, you are violating the owner's implicit sole copyright. As such, the copyright owner could request you to stop using their code, or worse, sue you for damages.
5. Unless I'm missing something, this section doesn't really contain any opinions. However, I do think that HTTP in the end is better than Gopher, because it is an open project. There are some downsides, however, to being fully open like HTTP is. Since anyone could make their own forks, this meant in the early days, there was an absence of any true standard, because there was no true governing body. This resulted in some scenarios where different HTTP clients would support different HTTP features. This was an even worse problem with HTML.
6. I decided to take a look at the .NET runtime, considering it's such a large company working on a very open project. I read the project's introduction documentation, and their main goal appears to be getting the project to be compatible on as many devices as possible, and make it used by as many applications as possible (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction). In order to do this, it makes sense to have the project be licensed under a permissive license such as MIT. If they were not to license it so openly, companies would be more hesitant to use the .NET framework in their applications. The .NET core and .NET framework haven't been open source forever, and you can see the positive effects that open source has had on the project by looking back in time. For example, the .NET framework used to not support operating systems other than Windows, but now it does!
